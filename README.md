Flashcard learning application with a flexible templating engine.


## Idea
Hootini App is the mobile version for the spaced repetition web application [Hootini](https://hootini.com/). 

What sets Hootini apart from other spaced repetition applications is its understandable and easy to use UI which, different from other similar apps, doesn't create a high entry barrier for first-time users.
